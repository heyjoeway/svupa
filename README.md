Svupa is a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) + [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) framework to create realtime apps with a single source of truth and optimistic updates.

Using Svupa, Supabase can serve as a Single Source of Truth for your data.
Every event (insert, update or delete) is directly streamed to the client, where a Svelte store is updated accordingly and the User Interface relfects the changes.
Additionally, Svupa offers an optimistic update mode, making your user interface more responsive.
